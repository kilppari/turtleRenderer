turtleRenderer

This was an experiment I created to learn more about OpenGL/Qt back in 2011. I originally developed this in Ubuntu 10.04, but recently got it to run in 12.04 as well with minor modifications. The code can be freely copied and used, see license.txt for more information.

Requires OpenGL and GLUT libraries to run.

The rendering engine illustrates techniques such as:
* Moving objects and hierachical kinematics
* Particle system (inelastic/elastic collisions)
* Clipping and antialiasing
* WaveFront object loader

Image of the application is found [here](https://github.com/kilppari/turtleRenderer/blob/master/turtlerenderer.jpg).
